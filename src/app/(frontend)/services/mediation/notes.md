How can it help me?

Most people have the ability to resolve conflict—what we often need is the right support.

Community mediation gives you the space, structure, and support to work through difficult conversations. It’s a voluntary process rooted in self-determination, where you decide the outcome—not a judge or an arbitrator.

Here’s how it helps:

You’re heard. Mediators are trained to listen deeply and make sure everyone has a chance to speak and be understood.
You stay in control. Mediators don’t take sides or give advice—they guide the conversation so you can find your own way forward.
You create the solutions. Together, you and the other person can identify solutions that meet your unique needs.
You’re not forced to decide. If you're not ready to resolve certain parts of the conflict, that’s okay. Mediation honors your pace.

Community mediation is a powerful alternative to hiring a lawyer or going to court. It’s collaborative, confidential, and often more sustainable—because the people involved created the agreement themselves.

Who are the mediators?
At MCRC, we use a co-mediator model, which means there are two mediators in each session. This ensures balance, collaboration, and greater support for everyone involved.
Each mediator is a specially trained volunteer from Howard County or a neighboring community. Mediators are here to:
Guide the conversation
Ensure everyone has space to speak and be heard
Support a respectful and productive process that includes tracking key concerns, values and ideas for resolution.

Mediators are not decision-makers. They don’t give advice or make judgments. Instead, they create a space for collaborative problem-solving so you and the other person can come up with solutions that fit your unique situation.

Why volunteers?
We depend on our volunteers because we believe in community-led solutions. Our mediators are everyday people—parents, teachers, neighbors—trained to support conversations that can lead to real change.

When Should I Think About Mediation?
Anytime you’re facing conflict and want support—that’s the right time.
Mediation can be helpful at any stage of a disagreement:
In the early days, when communication is breaking down
In the middle, when tension is growing
Even later, when things feel stuck or overwhelming

We often hear from people who say, “I wish we had tried this sooner.” Sometimes, folks wait until they're exhausted, angry, or on the brink of a major decision. You don’t have to wait that long.

Mediation is most powerful when it’s used early—before the conflict takes a toll on your well-being, your relationships, or your peace of mind.

If something feels off and you’re not sure how to talk about it, that’s a good time to reach out. We’re here to help.

What to Expect: The Mediation Process
Every mediation is different, but here’s what the journey typically looks like at MCRC. We move at the pace of trust, with respect for everyone’s story and voice.

Step 1: We Listen First
(Pre-Mediation Conversations)
Before anything else, we meet individually with each person involved. This is your chance to tell your story, ask questions, and learn more about how mediation works. We explain what to expect and talk through whether this process feels like a good fit for you.

This step helps us build understanding and ensures everyone is participating voluntarily and with clarity.

Step 2: We Find a Time That Works
(Scheduling Your Mediation)
If everyone agrees to move forward, we work together to schedule your session. We coordinate with two of our trained volunteer mediators to find a time and place that works for all involved—often in your neighborhood or online.

Step 3: We Ask for Your Consent
(Voluntary Participation & Agreements)
Before the session begins, all participants sign a simple agreement that outlines the voluntary and confidential nature of mediation. This ensures that everyone is entering the space willingly and with shared expectations.

Step 4: Everyone Gets to Speak
(Opening Conversation)
We start by inviting each person to share their perspective. Each participant has uninterrupted time to speak about what’s been happening and what matters to them. There’s no need to debate or convince—this is about being heard.

Step 5: We Look for Shared Ground
(Identifying Common Themes & Values)
With the support of mediators, you’ll begin to notice shared concerns or goals. In many conflicts, even if people disagree on the details, they often care about some of the same things—like feeling respected, keeping a neighborhood safe, or protecting a relationship.

Step 6: We Explore Possibilities
(Generating Solutions Together)
Once common ground is established, the group begins to explore ways forward. Mediators help guide the conversation as participants suggest ideas and alternatives that could address shared concerns. All ideas are welcomed—this is a space for creativity and collaboration.

Step 7: You Choose What Works
(Considering Each Option)
Together, you’ll reflect on each possible solution—what might work, what needs adjusting, and whether it feels fair. Sometimes an agreement is reached, and sometimes the process leads to a better understanding, even if full agreement isn’t yet possible.

Step 8: We Reflect
(After the Mediation)
At the end of the process, we invite participants to share how it felt, what they learned, and what next steps—if any—they’d like to take. This final reflection helps us improve, and it gives you a chance to close the conversation with clarity and care.

A Note from Us
We believe conflict is a part of being in community—and that navigating it with care, clarity, and connection is possible. Mediation isn’t about winners and losers. It’s about creating space for change, for dignity, and for forward movement.

Family Mediation helps to resolve disputes in households
A family may include a wide range of interpersonal relationships that include but are not limited to:
Two parents (married or not) and one or more children;
Married couple
One parent and one or more children in their custody
A household or group of people such as grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins
Elder Care Mediation
As parents age, care planning can become a challenge for families and loved ones. Mediation offers a process to help guide and focus those discussions, ensuring all parties feel heard as plans evolve.
Parent/Child
Do you find yourself having communication issues with your child, or having the same arguments over and over? Mediation can help you explore the underlying issues. Do you have a child who recently earned their driver’s license? Or a new curfew? Do you have an adult child moving back into your home or moving a parent into your home ? Mediation can help you explore expectations, create guidelines/rules, etc.
Parenting Plan
If you are separating, divorcing with children, or needing modifications to an existing plan, mediation can help you create a co-parenting plan. A way to move forward, apart, while keeping the values you wish to raise your children with at the forefront of your path moving forward.
Separation Services
If you need to support living arrangements and future plans regarding separation, mediation can be useful. Our goal is to help you navigate the separation process with dignity and clarity allowing you to move forward.  
Landlord/Tenant
Disputes between landlords and tenants can be stressful and time consuming. Mediation can be a cost effective pathway to resolve challenges without engaging with the sheriff's office and the courts. If you are facing issues related to rent payments, lease terms, maintenance concerns, accessibility or compliance issues as well as eviction matters, mediation can help find a solution that works for everyone.
Medical
We can support the resolution of disputes that may arise in the healthcare setting. If you are facing disagreements such as:
Challenges with a care plan
Administration challenges that interrupt provider patient communication
Misunderstandings over medical records
Family disputes regarding patient care or medical decisions
Roommate conflicts
Living with roommates is not always easy. If you find that sharing a living space is stressful and conflicts are becoming more difficult to resolve like disagreements over cleanliness or noise issues? Or perhaps there is a lack of clarity around guest policies or personal space concerns. Mediation can help identify the underlying reasons behind the conflict and brainstorm potential solutions that address everyone’s needs and concerns.
School
School administrators and counselors often refer cases to mediation. Parents, guardians and caregivers may also request mediation for school-based conflicts such as bullying, interpersonal conflict, community/neighbor conflicts spilling over into the school or vice versa, etc.
