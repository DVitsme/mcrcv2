Facilitation
What Is Group Facilitation?

We also offer Listening Sessions—intentional spaces designed for communities, workplaces, and organizations to share perspectives, process difficult topics, and build understanding. These sessions create opportunities for groups to be heard, reflect on concerns, and explore ways forward together.
Our goal is always the same: to hold space where people can show up, speak honestly, and move forward—together.
Who We Work With
We support neighborhood groups, nonprofits, schools, families, community colleges, and coalitions who are doing the work of building stronger communities. If your group is facing a big question, a shift in direction, or a time of tension or change, we’re here to help guide the conversation.
How Our Facilitation Services Can Help
We design and lead conversations that help your group move forward with clarity and care.
Here are a few ways facilitation might support you:

Shaping the goals of a new advisory board
Working through a strategic plan or organizational priorities
Building trust after a conflict or loss
Supporting equity-focused conversations or hard decision-making
Creating space for everyone to be heard and valued

We keep conversations grounded, inclusive, and productive—so your group can stay connected to its purpose.
Our Approach: Trained Local Facilitators
Our facilitators are staff and trained volunteers who live in or near the communities we serve. They bring deep listening skills, cultural awareness, and a commitment to restorative practices. We often use circle processes and consensus-building to make sure each participant can contribute in a meaningful way.

We believe community change happens through relationships—and that the best facilitation supports not just what’s said, but how we say it to one another.

Sliding Scale Pricing
We offer our facilitation services on a sliding scale based on your organization’s budget. No one is turned away due to lack of funds. We believe every group deserves access to skilled, community-rooted facilitation—regardless of financial resources.
